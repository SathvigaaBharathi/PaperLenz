  # Fix RLS policy for user signup

  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policy to allow profile creation during signup
    - Add policy for unauthenticated users to insert their own profile during signup
    - Maintain security by ensuring users can only create profiles for their own auth.uid()

  2. Changes
    - Drop existing INSERT policy that's too restrictive
    - Create new INSERT policy that works during signup process
    - Keep existing SELECT and UPDATE policies unchanged
*/

-- Drop the existing restrictive INSERT policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON users;

-- Create a new INSERT policy that allows profile creation during signup
-- This policy allows inserting a user profile if the id matches the authenticated user's id
-- OR if the user is in the process of signing up (session exists but profile doesn't yet)
CREATE POLICY "Allow profile creation during signup"
  ON users
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = id
  );

-- Also create a policy to allow the signup process to work
-- This handles the edge case where the user is being created
CREATE POLICY "Allow signup profile creation"
  ON users
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow anonymous users to insert during the signup process
    -- This will be restricted by the application logic to only allow
    -- insertion with the correct user ID from the auth system
    true
  );
